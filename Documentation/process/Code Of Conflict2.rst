Your code and ideas behind it will be carefully reviewed,
 often resulting in critique and criticism.
 The review will almost always require improvements
 to the code before it can be included in the kernel.
 Know that this happens because everyone involved wants 
 to see the best possible solution for the overall success
 of Linux. .... If however, anyone feels personally abused,
 threatened, or otherwise uncomfortable due to this process,
 that is not acceptable.
 ... As a reviewer of code,
 please strive to keep things civil and focused on the technical issues involved.
